## 🚀 Project Title
**Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & Page Design**

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this internship task was to explore **Bootstrap 5** and design a set of **modern, clean, and responsive web pages** by creatively combining Bootstrap components instead of simply copy-pasting from examples.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project includes **three responsive web pages**:

1. **Home Page (index.html)** – Contains a Navbar, Hero section, and Feature Cards.  
2. **About Page (about.html)** – Describes the project’s mission, vision, and values.  
3. **Contact Page (contact.html)** – Includes a working Bootstrap contact form.

All pages maintain a **consistent blue and white theme**, clean spacing, and responsive design.  
The website follows a mobile-first approach using Bootstrap’s grid and utility classes.

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Process

1. **Exploration:**  
   - Studied the official [Bootstrap 5 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).  
   - Learned about components like navbars, cards, carousels, and forms.

2. **Component Selection:**  
   - Selected useful and visually consistent UI components.  
   - Focused on keeping colors, spacing, and layouts uniform.

3. **Design & Development:**  
   - Built all three pages using Bootstrap 5.  
   - Used utility classes like `py-5`, `text-center`, and `container` for proper alignment.

4. **Testing Responsiveness:**  
   - Tested layouts on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.  
   - Ensured navbar and cards resize perfectly.

5. **Hosting the Project:**  
   - Uploaded all files to GitHub.  
   - Deployed live using **GitHub Pages** for easy access.
